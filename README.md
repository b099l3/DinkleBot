## Why the Name
Where did the name "Dinklebot" come from initially?
>Ghosts were sometimes called "Dinklebots" by players, as a nod to Peter Dinklage,[23](https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost#cite_note-23) who provided their voice in the game. As of The Taken King, Nolan North replaced Dinklage as Ghost's voice actor and redubbed lines from the original Destiny game.[24](https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost#cite_note-24) Players have started to call this new Ghost "Nolandroid", though Nolan North himself prefers "Nolanbot".[25](https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost#cite_note-25)
