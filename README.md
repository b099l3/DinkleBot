# DinkleBot

Dinklebot is a companion app for [Destiny 2](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/BeyondLight), and I plan to use/learn about modern swift patterns in this app:
- Use coordinator pattern ✅
- Use MVVM ❌
- Use Realm ❌
- Use Alamorfire ❌
- Unit Tests ❌
- Integration Tests ❌
- Snapshot Tests ❌
- XCUITests ❌


MVP:
- Show the current mods available at Banshee 44 and Ada 1 for today ❌
- Show if the current player has these mods ❌
- Other things I find helpful for the game...

## Where did the name "Dinklebot" come from initially?
>Ghosts were sometimes called "Dinklebots" by players, as a nod to Peter Dinklage,[23](https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost#cite_note-23) who provided their voice in the game. As of The Taken King, Nolan North replaced Dinklage as Ghost's voice actor and redubbed lines from the original Destiny game.[24](https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost#cite_note-24) Players have started to call this new Ghost "Nolandroid", though Nolan North himself prefers "Nolanbot".[25](https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost#cite_note-25)
