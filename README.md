# DinkleBot

Dinklebot is a companion app for [Destiny 2](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/BeyondLight). 

I plan to use this project to learn about modern swift patterns, test out new frameworks/libraries and maintain a knowledge base.

## Why the Name
Where did the name "Dinklebot" come from initially?
>Ghosts were sometimes called "Dinklebots" by players, as a nod to Peter Dinklage,[23](https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost#cite_note-23) who provided their voice in the game. As of The Taken King, Nolan North replaced Dinklage as Ghost's voice actor and redubbed lines from the original Destiny game.[24](https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost#cite_note-24) Players have started to call this new Ghost "Nolandroid", though Nolan North himself prefers "Nolanbot".[25](https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost#cite_note-25)
